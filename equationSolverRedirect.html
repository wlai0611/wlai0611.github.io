I created a web app that solves systems of linear equations using base Python and NumPy.<br>
The app can be accessed at this link: <a href="https://walter-classifier.herokuapp.com/equationSolver">Equation Solver</a><br>
The code for the app can be accessed here: <a href="https://github.com/wlai0611/vectorized_gram_schmidt/blob/master/vectorized_gram_schmidt.py">Source Code</a>
